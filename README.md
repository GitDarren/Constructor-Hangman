### Homework Assignment for UT Coding Bootcamp - Austin

* This is a command line Hangman Game 
* Built on javascript and node.js to run in the console using constructor functions
* Utilizes Inquirer and Chalk packages to engage the user, display their response and make it look colorful.

## Description of Game

* Ask the User if they wish to play the "Constructor Hangman"
* Display an array of underscores representing the word answer
* Prompt the user to make a guess
* If the user guesses a correct letter, the letter will fill in the appropriate blank along with a console log saying "Correct!"
* If the user guess a wrong letter, the user will recieve a prompt saying they guess wronged and show how many guesses they have remaining before they lose the game.
* Repeat the steps of Guess Prompt through wrong guess until either:
  * The user completes the word with guesses remaining, they will get a "You win" prompt and asked if they wish to play again.
  * Or the user uses up all their guesses, they will get a prompt saying they "Sorry, you lose.  Please try again!" They will be asked if they wish to play again.
* Regardless if they win or lose, if they chose to play again, they will be given a new word and a full allotment of guesses.

* I'm not thrilled about the Eagles/Patriots Superbowl, but the only saving grace is that if the Patriots lose, it will be a team with even worse fans than the Patriots.
